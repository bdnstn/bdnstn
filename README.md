- 👋 Hi, I’m @bdnstn
- 👀 I’m currently interested in home automation.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Zigbee, Z-Wave and Home Assistant.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anythig I can that is related to my current interests, but my skills in that area are very basic. However, I've been working on hardware and software for decades, so I hope it wont be long before I can make a contribution.
